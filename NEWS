        CHANGES IN spatstat.linnet VERSION 2.3-1

OVERVIEW

    o More control over resolution of 'linim' objects.
    
    o Improved documentation.

    o Minor improvements and bug fixes.
    
SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o as.linim.default, as.linim.linfun
    New argument 'nd'

    o integral.linfun
    New argument 'nd'

    o rjitterlpp, rjitter.lpp
    The function 'rjitterlpp' has been renamed 'rjitter.lpp'
    and is now a method for the generic 'rjitter'.

    o rjitterlpp
    This function still exists, but is now deprecated in favour of 'rjitter.lpp'.

BUG FIXES

    o rjitterlpp
    The argument 'radius' was interpreted as a fraction of segment length
    rather than an absolute distance.
    Fixed.

OVERVIEW

    o We thank Suman Rakshit, Greg McSwiggan and Marc Schneble
    for contributions.

    o Sufficient Dimension Reduction on a linear network.
    
    o Perspective-view plots of linfun and linim objects.
    
    o Bug fix to Math.linim

    o Minor additions.

NEW FUNCTIONS

    o sdr.lpp
    Sufficient Dimension Reduction on a linear network.
    [Contributed by Suman Rakshit.]
    
    o persp.linfun, persp.linim
    Perspective-view plots of functions on a linear network (class linim)
    and images on a linear network (class linfun).
    [Written by Adrian Baddeley and Greg McSwiggan.]
    
SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o response.lppm
    Method for 'response' for fitted point process models on a network.

BUG FIXES

    o Math.linim
    If 'Z' was a pixel image on a network (class 'linim')
    and 'v' was a single number, then 'Z/v' was a pixel image (class 'im')
    instead of a pixel image on a network (class 'linim').
    [Spotted by Marc Schneble.]
    Fixed.

    o bw.voronoi
    Printed output stated that the cross-validation criterion was minimised
    instead of maximised.


        CHANGES IN spatstat.linnet VERSION 2.2-1

OVERVIEW

    o Minor changes to satisfy CRAN.

        CHANGES IN spatstat.linnet VERSION 2.2-0

OVERVIEW

    o Extensions to rhohat.lpp and rhohat.lppm.
    
    o Internal bug fixes.

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o rhohat.lpp, rhohat.lppm
    New option (smoother='piecewise') computes a piecewise-constant
    estimate of rho(z).

    o rhohat.lpp, rhohat.lppm
    The result now includes the 'average' intensity rho.

        CHANGES IN spatstat.linnet VERSION 2.1-1

OVERVIEW

    o Tweak to satisfy the package checker.


        CHANGES IN spatstat.linnet VERSION 2.1-0

OVERVIEW

    o We thank Andrea Gilardi for contributions.

    o Bug fix in density.lpp

    o Improvement to densityEqualSplit

    o New function for jittering point patterns on a network.

    o Function renamed.

NEW FUNCTIONS

    o rjitterlpp
    Apply random displacements to the points on a linear network.

    o densityHeat.lpp
    Diffusion kernel estimation of intensity on a linear network.
    (formerly known as 'densityHeatlpp' and 'densityHeat', this is
    now a method for the new generic 'densityHeat')

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o densityEqualSplit
    New arguments 'at' and 'leaveoneout' for consistency with other functions.

    o densityHeat
    The function formerly known as 'densityHeat' or 'densityHeatlpp'
    is now renamed 'densityHeat.lpp' and is a method for the generic
    'densityHeat'.

    o density.lpp
    Accelerated when the pattern contains duplicated points.
    
BUG FIXES

    o density.lpp
    The result had the wrong length if 'x' contained duplicated points
    when 'weights' were given and 'at="points"'.
    [Spotted by Andrea Gilardi]
    Fixed.

        CHANGES IN spatstat.linnet VERSION 2.0-0

OVERVIEW

    o We thank Andrea Gilardi for contributions.

    o Function renamed.
    
    o Bug fix in density.lpp

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o densityHeat
    'densityHeat' has been temporarily renamed 'densityHeatlpp',
    to prevent errors in the package checking process.

    o [.linim
    Accelerated.


BUG FIXES

    o deviance.lppm, pseudoR2.lppm
    Results were completely incorrect, due to a coding error.
    Fixed.

    o density.lpp
    Crashed if 'weights' were given and 'x' contained duplicated points.
    [Spotted by Andrea Gilardi]
    Fixed.

    o Lcross.inhom, Kcross.inhom, Kmulti.inhom
    The option 'correction="none"' was accepted but ignored.
    [Spotted by Corey Anderson.]
    Fixed.

    o simulate.rhohat
    Crashed when applied to rhohat objects computed from data
    on a linear network.
    Fixed.
    

        CHANGES IN spatstat.linnet VERSION 1.65-9

OVERVIEW

    o Minor internal changes.

        CHANGES IN spatstat.linnet VERSION 1.65-8

OVERVIEW

    o Function renamed.

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o densityHeat
    'densityHeat' has been renamed 'densityHeat.lpp'.


        CHANGES IN spatstat.linnet VERSION 1.65-7

OVERVIEW

    o Tweaks to satisfy CRAN.


        CHANGES IN spatstat.linnet VERSION 1.65-1

OVERVIEW

    o Added NEWS file.


        CHANGES IN spatstat.linnet VERSION 1.65-0

OVERVIEW

    o Package initialised at version 1.65-0

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o spatstat.linnet
    The package 'spatstat.linnet' has been created from a subset
    of the code in the original 'spatstat' package version 1.65-0.
    It contains the functionality for statistical analysis of
    spatial data on a linear network.
    For an overview, see help("spatstat.linnet-package")

    o Execution
    The 'spatstat.linnet' package is slightly faster than the corresponding
    code in the 'spatstat' package, because the procedure for calling
    internal C functions has been streamlined.
